# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
  Rubocop, after hearing about it on a Ruby Rogues podcast, I decided to try it out and found it really helped me think about syntax and method lengths (amongst other things).
  While not integrated within the application it was a very useful gem to play with at this stage of my learning.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Simple Command Line UI
      Using .prompt on a Udacilist object will go into a command line prompt mode which allows the user to use the methods available to create, list, add and export items.
  b) Basic export to CSV option.
      Very basic export with two columns, the item number and item details.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  Between 3-5 hours.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  Getting rid of some of the Rubocop errors about Assignment Branch Condition size being too high.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  (Described above)
  I picked a command line UI since it felt like a good fit for such a program for it to be used by regular users.
  Just about every program needs to have some sort of user input, this was a first step to building one.
  The export is another useful feature to have and that many applications have and thus felt like a good fit for the application.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  I feel I use ifs and case statements too often, I will likely need to learn a way to reduce this use.
